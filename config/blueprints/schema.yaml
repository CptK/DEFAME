# Blueprint Schema Definition
# This file defines the structure for DEFAME verification blueprints

# Blueprint Structure:
# ------------------
# name: string - Unique identifier for the blueprint
# description: string - Human-readable description of when to use this blueprint
# claim_characteristics: list - Types of claims this blueprint is designed for
# iterations: list - Sequence of verification steps
#   - iteration: int - Iteration number (1-indexed)
#     actions: list - Actions to execute in this iteration
#       - action: string - Action name (must be in allowed_actions)
#         params: dict (optional) - Action-specific parameters
#     synthesis: bool (optional) - Whether to add explicit synthesis stage
# stopping_criteria: dict - When to stop verification
#   max_iterations: int - Maximum number of iterations
#   early_stop_conditions: list (optional) - Conditions for early stopping
#     - type: string - "high_confidence" | "no_new_evidence" | "contradiction_found"
#       threshold: float (optional) - Threshold for the condition

# Available Actions (from DEFAME):
# - search: Web search
# - credibility_check: Check source credibility
# - face_recognition: Identify faces in images
# - geolocate: Determine location from images
# - detect_objects: Detect objects in images
# - ocr: Extract text from images
# - detect_manipulation: Check for image manipulation
