  early_stop_conditions:
    - type: "timeline_established"

      threshold: 0.9

rationale: |
  Temporal claims require establishing accurate timeline from multiple sources.
  Multiple search iterations to gather evidence from different time periods.
  Synthesis in iteration 2 to establish initial timeline before further verification.
  Extended to 4 iterations maximum as temporal context may require deeper investigation.
