rationale: |
  Controversial claims need multiple independent sources to establish truth.
  First iteration gathers evidence from diverse sources (3 searches).
  Second iteration performs additional searches and synthesizes findings.
  Third iteration fills gaps if sources conflict or more evidence needed.
  Stops early if sources reach consensus.
