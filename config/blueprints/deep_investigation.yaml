rationale: |
  Complex claims require deep investigation with synthesis at each stage.
  Each iteration includes synthesis to integrate evidence before proceeding.
  Up to 5 iterations to allow thorough investigation of all claim aspects.
  Multiple searches per iteration to ensure comprehensive evidence gathering.
  This is the most thorough blueprint for the most challenging claims.
  Synthesis at every iteration ensures reasoning quality stays high.
