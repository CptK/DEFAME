rationale: |
  Multimodal claims require thorough image analysis before text-based verification.
  First iteration focuses on understanding the image content, detecting manipulation, and geolocation.
  Second iteration performs multiple searches for context using image-derived information.
  Third iteration verifies with additional sources.
  Synthesis after iterations 1 and 3 to integrate multimodal evidence.
