rationale: |
  Quote verification requires finding primary sources or official statements.
  Multiple searches in iteration 1 to find original source (speech, interview, post).
  Additional search in iteration 2 with synthesis to assess quote context and accuracy.
  Final search in iteration 3 if needed.
  Stops if primary source found or authoritative fact-check exists.
