rationale: |
  Numerical claims require finding authoritative sources with exact data.
  First search to find potential sources with the claimed numbers.
  Second iteration performs additional searches and synthesizes to compare numbers.
  Third iteration seeks primary sources or official statistics if needed.
  Stops early if authoritative source (government, research institution) found.
